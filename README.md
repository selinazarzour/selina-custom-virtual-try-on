# Selina's Custom Virtual Fashion Studio

Virtual try-on is rapidly becoming the future of fashion, enabling anyone to experiment with styles, outfits, and creativity from the comfort of their own home. This project is a personal playground for exploring the power of AI-driven, multi-modal virtual try-onâ€”where you can mix and match clothing, avatars, and backgrounds using both images and text prompts.

## About This Project

This app is built with Python, Gradio, and OpenCV, and leverages a powerful diffusion-based API for generating virtual try-on results. The backend API is accessed via RapidAPI, making it easy to connect and experiment without running heavy models locally.

- **Frontend:** Gradio (interactive web UI)
- **Backend:** Cloud API (via RapidAPI)
- **Features:**
  - Try on clothing using images or text prompts
  - Swap avatars and backgrounds
  - Experiment with creative fashion ideas

**Note:** This is a personal, non-commercial project. All API usage is subject to RapidAPI's terms and any applicable quotas.

Enjoy exploring the future of virtual fashion!
